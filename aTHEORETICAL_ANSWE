1. Singly Linked List

Uses:

Dynamic data storage
Stack and Queue implementations
Hash table chaining
Memory management
Pros:

Fast insertion/deletion at head (O(1))
Dynamic size (no fixed capacity)
Memory efficient for dynamic data
Cons:

No random access (must traverse from head)
Extra memory for pointers
One-directional traversal only
2. Circular Linked List
Uses:

Round-robin scheduling
Circular buffers
Multi-player games
Operating system task management
Pros:

Can traverse from any node
Efficient for circular applications
No need to check for null tail
Cons:

Risk of infinite loops
More complex implementation
Harder to detect end of list
3. Doubly Linked List
Uses:

Browser forward/back navigation
Undo/Redo functionality
Music playlists
Operating system memory management
Pros:

Bidirectional traversal
Easier deletion of arbitrary nodes
Efficient reverse operations
Cons:

More memory (two pointers per node)
More complex code
More pointer updates needed
4. Quick Comparison Table
Type	Traversal	Memory	Complexity	Common Use
Singly	One-way	Low	Medium	Stack, Queue
Circular	Circular	Medium	Medium	Round-robin
Doubly	Two-way	High	High	Browser, Undo
